# 2Gather

## Inspiration
During Covid, we oftentimes felt disconnected from our friends and family as social distancing prevented us from interacting with the people close to us. When people are disconnected from the things and people that they love, they often experience problems with depression and other avenues of their life. From our experience of boredom and disconnection due to Covid, came our idea for 2Gather.

## What it does
2Gather is a website that lets you find your interests and connect with others through those interests. Users can place activities up to a community of users who are interested in similar things. Through these activities, users can bond together and make new friends finding people who like the same things they do. While Covid broke and separated people from each other, 2Gather aims to form relationships and connections between users who like similar things; all one connection at a time.
## How we built it
2Gather was built with a combination of Elixir for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend supported by React Bootstrap.
